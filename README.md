### Submission for: [GUI INU Ideathon – Build with $GUI](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/gui-inu-ideathon/detail)

## 🧩 Summary (250 Words Max)

**Meme Pet League** is a meme-native social game where users adopt and evolve digital meme pets by spending $GUI. These pets can be flexed, tipped, or voted into seasonal meme leagues, all governed by the community. It’s a fun, decentralized way to build a strong culture around $GUI while giving the token real social utility.

Every interaction—feeding, tipping, voting—costs $GUI. This creates a viral loop where GUI holders gain social status, earn rewards, and compete for meme dominance. As meme pets climb ranks, they become symbols of prestige in the GUI ecosystem.

This isn’t just about cute pets—it's a gamified social protocol designed to encourage engagement, grow the $GUI user base, and amplify network effects through culture, competition, and DAO-powered governance.

## ✨ Visual Mockup Prompt for AGI Tools

Use this in tools like [Galileo AI](https://www.usegalileo.ai) or [Framer AI](https://framer.com/ai):

> "Design a web dashboard for a meme pet social game. Include: a main avatar viewer, three buttons (‘Feed Pet’, ‘Enter League’, ‘Tip with $GUI’), a leaderboard of top meme pets, a tipping pop-up with user comments, and a DAO voting section for pet evolution rules. Style it to be meme-friendly, colorful, mobile-first, and virally shareable."

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Meme Pet League is more than a game—it’s a social protocol for the $GUI ecosystem. It gives every user a role to play, every $GUI a purpose, and every meme a path to fame. Whether you’re tipping a pet, training one, or voting on seasonal rules, you’re helping to grow the GUI culture—one flex at a time.

This project aligns perfectly with the Ideathon’s goals: community, creativity, and meaningful use of the $GUI token on Aptos. Let’s evolve GUI culture together. 🐾
